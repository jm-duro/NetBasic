-- Description:
--     Euphoria utility functions to retrieve short and long descriptions
--     of Winsock error codes.
--
-- Global Functions:
--     WSGetErrorString(i)      Return symbolic error string for error code 'i'
--     WSGetShortDescription(i) Return a short text description of the error
--     WSGetLongDescription(i)  Return a long text description of the error
--
-- Known limitations:
--     1.  List of Winsock error codes may not be complete.
--     2.  This library has only been tested with Winsock 2.
